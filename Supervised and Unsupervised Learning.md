# Supervised learning
- **Labeled** datasets -> **ground truth** 
- much more resource intensive than unsupervised learning, but also more accurate
- most breakthroughs happened in this field
- Goal: classifying or **predicting** (regression) outcomes, understanding existing relationship between variables
- **Classification** problems: 
	- filter out spam emails
	- Algorithms: Linear classifiers, support vector machines, decision trees and random forests
- **Regression** problems:
	- predicting numerical values
	- Algorithms: linear, logistic and polynomial regression


# Unsupervised learning 
- **Unlabeled** datasets
- Goal: discover **hidden** patterns
- Algorithms: 
	- Clustering: K-means clustering
	- Association
	- Dimension reduction: too many features, it reduces number of data inputs, while preserving data integrity. Preprocessing data stage, like removing noise from visual data.
